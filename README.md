# moviebookingproject
A movie booking project in C would typically involve creating a program that allows users to select a movie from a list, choose a seat, and purchase a ticket. The program would use C language constructs to prompt the user for input, validate the input, and output information to the screen

Here is a simple description of the steps involved:

Define the movie and seat data structures - This would involve creating a data structure to store information about each movie, such as its name, runtime, and ticket type, as well as a data structure to store information about each seat in the theater, such as its row and seat number.

Display the list of available movies - The program would display a list of available movies to the user and prompt them to choose one.

Allow the user to select a seat - The user would then be prompted to select a seat from the available seats.

Validate the input - The program would validate the user's input to ensure that they have chosen a valid seat and that the seat is still available.

Display the ticket information - Finally, the program would display the ticket information to the user, including the movie name, seat number, and ticket price and runtime.
